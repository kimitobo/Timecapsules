# Making the Cup
## Solder the PCB


### 1. Solder the 100nF (104) (usually)brown capacitor below the audio jack footprint

### 2. Solder 2x 22Kohm voltage divider resitors undet the first cap

### 3. Solder 470ohm LED resistor on the opposite side of the center

4. Solder the audio jack in place

5. Solder the chip socket in place

6. Place the 3mm white LED in the middle, longer leg (anode) pointing to the LED resistor. (the picture does not yet have the jack or socket in place. Recommended to do these before the LED)

7. Bend down the anode and solder on the plate next to the LED resistor

8. Bend down the other leg (cathode: can be recognised from the flat side of the LED lense) on the opposite side of the center hole.

9. Solder the power wires in place
