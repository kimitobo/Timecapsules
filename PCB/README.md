Timecapsules PCB is a simple board designed for workshop purposes. It's based on the same ATtiny+audiobootloader platform as 8BitMixtape and its derivatives. ATtiny85 -chip controls LED or RGB-LED, has a place for few sensors like LDR & POT. One side of the circular board has alligator clip holes for VCC, GND and programming. ATtiny 85 chip DIP chip socket fits on its place when pins are bent 90 degrees out and edges trimmed a bit. There is a SOIC footprint in the middle of the socket for SMD version of the ATtiny85.

Notice: The first version contains one mistake, the RGB LED footprint on the front side of the board is mirrored, can't be used unless traces are cut & vias reconnected horizontally mirroring. The component side is correct.
