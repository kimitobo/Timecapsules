## Concepts for cross-eon communication -workshop

How to send messages to the future? What messages should or should not be sent? Is someone trying to send us messages from the past but we are not listening? Some attempts have been made to send warning messages of our nuclear waste 100.000 years to the future but the task seem to be impossible.

In this workshop, we take more playful approach and try to map various scenarios for knowledge transfer over different timespans, from 10 seconds to 10 million years - distilled bits of our culture, maybe poems, maybe self-executable code, maybe recipies of our food, maybe rules of our games.

We make few quick conceptual experiments: one on disappearing messages, using light, smoke or sound and one thought experiment on cross-eon messaging. On the more practical part of the workshop, we make time capsules of our own, trying to store both digital and analog information over duration of our choosing. The participants can think this as a personal token to be passed on in the family, or as their very own “Voyager Golden Record”, sent to unknown civilizations. Various materials and methods are available for the making.

# Excercise 1
## Messages lasting merely seconds

Some messages does not need to last long, "See you in five mins" - has very little value after ten minutes. Some messages should be destroyed immediately. "This message will self destruct in five seconds" means that there is a "Mission Impossible" ahead and the details of it should be memorised. 

In this excercise we first discuss and design short ephemeral messages and then try few techniques sending them only few seconds ahead in time using our voice, smoke of a insence and drawing with light.  For research purposes we can document this with recorder and camera but perhaps we destroy the evidence after the feedback session. :)

# Excercise 2
## Messages lasting almost forever

Are there any? Not sent by us that's for sure. Is there, or has there been civilisation that communicates beyond time? Perhaps, but why can't we hear or see the message? "Where are they?" asks the Fermi Paradox. How far ahead in the future we, Homo Sapiens, can send our longest lasting faxes. To start answerng that, we can always look back. Our species is about 315.000 years old. For reference, rocks we chisel have been around 3.500.000.000 years. Go rocks! Our ancestors made some cave paintings 50.000 years ago, messages? unlikely sent deliberately to us to be received on 21st centory and beyond.
