How to send messages to the future? What messages should or should not be sent? Is someone trying to send us messages from the past but we are not listening? Some attempts have been made to send warning messages of our nuclear waste 100.000 years to the future but the task seem to be impossible.

In this workshop, we take more playful approach and try to map various scenarios for knowledge transfer over different timespans, from 10 seconds to 10 million years - distilled bits of our culture, maybe poems, maybe self-executable code, maybe recipies of our food, maybe rules of our games.
